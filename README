A Ruby API for Google Analytics.

= WARNING

This is unstable and will remain so for a bit. Do not use it right now unless you are hoping for things to go boom. :)

Feel free however to hack at it and send me patches.


== Authenticate

Login with your Google Analytics user name and password:

 Rugalytics.login 'username', 'password'


== Obtain Profile

Get profile using account name and profile name:

 profile = Rugalytics.find_profile('your_site.com', 'blog.your_site.com')


If account name and profile name are the same:

 profile = Rugalytics.find_profile('your_site.com')
